I'm a Research Engineer at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/) in Berlin, where I apply data science and computational social science methods to address pressing policy challenges. My work sits at the intersection of technology, governance, and sustainability, with a particular focus on making artificial intelligence systems more environmentally responsible.

Currently, my research centers on the energy efficiency and environmental impact of large language models (LLMs) and other machine learning systems. As AI becomes increasingly central to policy-making and public services, understanding and optimizing its resource footprint is critical for sustainable digital transformation. I develop frameworks and tools to measure, benchmark, and improve the energy consumption of AI systems, contributing to the broader goal of sustainable computing.

My approach combines rigorous quantitative analysis with practical policy implementation, working closely with governmental and international organizations to translate research insights into actionable recommendations. I'm particularly interested in how computational methods can inform evidence-based policymaking in areas such as climate change mitigation, digital governance, and the responsible development of AI technologies.
